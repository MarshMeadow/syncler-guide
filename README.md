# Reviews (r/providers4syncler): 

**Before I start this is the best guide that i could find to set up this app.**

Q/A 1: "do i need premium?"

- Q/A: "installed all the packages but keeps saying 0 sources found. Is this cus i need premium?"

Q/A 2: "Syncler+ Help":

- Q/A: "Sorry Nubi ! Anybody have any help for a nubi, every provider package that I enter into Syncler+ says installed failed? I can't get any packages to install. Any and all advice would be great."

**So after reading that, it looks like people are having problems, let me/us know what you get..**
